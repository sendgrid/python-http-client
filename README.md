# Quick Start

Here is a quick example:

`GET /your/api/{param}/call`

```python
import python_http_client
global_headers = {"Authorization": "Basic XXXXXXX"}
client = Client(host='base_url', request_headers=global_headers)
client.your.api._(param).call.get()
print response.status_code
print response.headers
print response.body
```

`POST /your/api/{param}/call` with headers, query parameters and a request body with versioning.

```python
import python_http_client
global_headers = {"Authorization": "Basic XXXXXXX"}
client = Client(host='base_url', request_headers=global_headers)
query_params={"hello":0, "world":1}
request_headers={"X-Test": "test"}
data={"some": 1, "awesome": 2, "data": 3}
response = client.your.api._(param).call.post(request_body=data,
                                              query_params=query_params,
